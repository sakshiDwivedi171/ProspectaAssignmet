Suppose we have a CSV file with the data given below.

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

This can be represented in an excel sheet below:

A  B  C

1  5  3      =5+A1

2  7  8      =A2+B2

3  9  =4+5   =C2+B3

A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3

This can be represented in an excel sheet below:

A B C

1 5 3 =5+A1

2 7 8 =A2+B2

3 9 =4+5 =C2+B3

I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output 
with the results. If it is a value, then return a value. If it is a formula then
 calculate the formula and return the value of that formula
 


Ques 1.How will you tackle the challenge above?

Ans 1. I solve this challenge by the following steps:-

step1=> I will create a file with name csv.file in my current directory and put this information
        inside that in a single line like written on the above.
        
step2=> after that I will convert this whole string in Array of String using split method.
        String[] arr = input.split(", ");
        
step3=> then, I will create a map and store it in the form of key-value pairs using loop and split method.
        Map<String, String> variables = new LinkedHashMap<>();   
        
step4=> After that I will create a Map to convert the string values in the form of Integer value.
        With the help of running a loop on first map I will check that there is simple Integer value or any 
        function is there.
        
step5=> Solve the basic functionality like, how to tackle the basic mapping through calculation         
          
        
step6=> then at last, I will loop the map using entry and show the result in form of new key-value pairs.         



Ques2. What type of errors you would you check for?

Ans 2. Extra care of the basic sign like = , : and + sign as well.
       
       This whole process can't be done without propper mapping
       
       I will use Regular Expressions to match it.
       
       To solve this I tried to use split and trim methods. 

Ques 3.How might a user break your code?

Ans 3. User can break my code by doing some changes inside CSV file. 
       Like if user will change the format of input of input then this code will not work and if 
       user will value of numbers which more than the Max value of
       Integer then also it will not work properly.
