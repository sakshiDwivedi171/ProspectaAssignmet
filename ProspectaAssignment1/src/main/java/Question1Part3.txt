Question: What are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure 
          that it is secure and reliable?
          
Answer : There are several key things to consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure 
         it is secure and reliable those are as follows:-
         
Authentication and Authorization ==> You should ensure that your API requires authentication and 
                                     authorization for access. This will help prevent unauthorized 
                                     access and protect sensitive data.
                                     
Input Validation ==> You should validate all input data to ensure it is valid and safe. This can help 
                     prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. 
                     
Encryption ==> It is a very important part of a application that means all the sensitive data should be
                encrypted inside our application. 
                
Error Handling ==> You should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the client.

Monitoring ==> You should monitor the API to ensure it is performing as expected and to detect any issues 
               that may arise.
               
               
These are basic key points that we should keep in mind while developing an application.
